# Serverless Architectures with Azure
- [Prerequisites](Session%20Prerequisites/Readme.md)

## Description
Serverless architecture is all the buzz and a relatively new approach to delivering software in the Cloud.  It allows you to solve business problems quickly and leverage other pieces of Cloud simple and easy while providing these solutions relatively quickly.  This new breed of microservice architecture allows you to choose between a consumption-based model, pay for what you use, or an App Service Plan/VM backed model for better control over your microservice environment. The goal of the course is to learn to design, architect, develop, build, and deploy serverless resources.  These resources will include Azure Functions, Azure Logic Apps, and Azure Event Grid.  We will learn how to leverage both the Azure Portal and Visual Studio, to provide these solutions and explain what it means when you choose one over the other.  We will also learn how to build and deploy these solutions using Azure DevOps to manage the deployment to Azure. The labs throughout this course will help provide a working knowledge of how to build serverless applications to use storage, queues, tables, service bus, event hubs, Azure DevOps, scheduling, and data repositories like CosmosDB and SQL.  As we journey through our serverless architecture and development we will learn best practices and how to troubleshoot and test this new and exciting serverless environment.

## What is this training about and why is it important?
This training is aimed at improving your application architecture and is designed to help to understand and to implement applications using serverless resources.  You will be able to know when to use serverless resources and how to connect them to other cloud resources.  You will also learn best practices in reflection to the serverless resources.

## What you’ll learn—and how you can apply it

1.	How to create a Function App and set up Visual Studio for local development of functions
2.	Steps to create multiple Azure functions and explain all concepts including Bindings, Triggers, events, and integrating with other services and configuration 
3.	Testing, troubleshooting and best practices for implementing and deploying Azure functions 
4.	Using Event Grid in your serverless applications
5.	Using DevOps to Deploy and manage your serverless applications
